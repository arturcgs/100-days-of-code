How to calculate typing speed:

GROSS WPM:

Number of characters typed in a minute (with no typos), divided by five.

A word is any five characters. Spaces, punctuations, numbers, are all included.

NET WPM:

Gross WPM - (Uncorrected Error / Time)

Accuracy:

Percentage of correct entries

Correct entries / Total entries * 100


Program Idea:

A screen shows up, with the options to start or exit
This screen can show the best time (maybe)

If you start, a new window will show up, with a text and a input place.
After 2 minutes, the window closes, and the main screen now shows the score that you got (and maybe the best score)
